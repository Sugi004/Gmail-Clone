## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The Gmail Clone Application is a simple email system that allows users to create accounts, send, and receive emails using a local SMTP server. This application is designed for local testing and development purposes.

Initially I have created 2 accounts testaccount@gmail.com and testaccount2@gmail.com and made a email communication between them.
